# hotel-manager-front

This app, like the others you will find here, are personal projects that will probably never be deployed to production because were developed with the aim of learning something new.

In this app I try to make use of Clean Architecture with DDD.

React front-end will be developed based on the following learning resources:
- [Frontend Clean Architecture by Alex Bespoyasov](https://github.com/bespoyasov/frontend-clean-architecture)
- [4Dev React - Enquetes para Programadores by Rodrigo Manguinho](https://github.com/rmanguinho/clean-react)
- [Sample code of React with Clean architecture by falsy](https://github.com/falsy/react-with-clean-architecture)
- [Arquitectura CLEAN para aplicaciones en React by Osman Cea](https://github.com/daslaf/react-clean-architecture)

Reference:
- [The Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
